# console-blackjack
This is a simple console blackjack game where the player plays vs a computer.

# The rules are simple 
You get dealt 2 random cards and you type hit in order to be dealt the next one.
There is a catch though since your total sum of cards can't be larger than 21, or you'll go bust.
When you are finished and happy with your cards, you type stay and the dealer shows you his cards and starts hitting if his sum is lower than 17.
Same rule of 21 applies to the dealer. 

# End of Game
If you and the dealer have finished the game without going bust, the sums are compared and the higher one wins!
Good Luck!
